# Portfolio Updates Summary

## Changes Completed

### 1. ✅ Removed Earnings Growth Column

**Issue**: Earnings Growth was redundant with EPS Growth (they show the same data)

**Changes Made**:
- **Frontend (`PortfolioTable.tsx`)**:
  - Removed `earningsGrowth` from SortConfig interface
  - Removed earnings growth sorting logic  
  - Removed "Earnings Growth" header column
  - Removed earnings growth table cell from tbody
- **Result**: EPS Growth column remains, showing the same data as the removed Earnings Growth

### 2. ✅ Added Watchlist-Only Stock Support (Quantity = 0)

**Issue**: Users wanted to track stocks they don't own yet (watchlist functionality)

**Changes Made**:

#### Frontend (`App.tsx`):
- **Form Validation**: Updated to allow quantity ≥ 0 (previously required > 0)
- **Conditional Fields**: Purchase price and date are disabled/optional when quantity = 0
- **UI Labels**: Added helpful text "(0 for watchlist only)" and "(N/A for watchlist)"
- **Smart Validation**: Purchase price only required when quantity > 0

#### Frontend (`PortfolioTable.tsx`):
- **Display Logic**: Shows "N/A" for purchase price, date, total value, and gain/loss when quantity = 0
- **Color Coding**: Uses gray text for "N/A" values instead of red/green indicators

#### Backend (`portfolio.ts`):
- **Validation Schema**: Updated Zod schemas to allow quantity ≥ 0 and purchasePrice ≥ 0
- **Smart Validation**: Added `.refine()` logic to require purchasePrice > 0 only when quantity > 0

#### Backend (`portfolioService.ts`):
- **Calculation Logic**: When quantity = 0, sets totalValue, gainLoss, and gainLossPercent to undefined
- **Portfolio Summary**: Only includes owned stocks (quantity > 0) in financial totals, but counts all items in itemCount

## New User Experience

### Adding Owned Stocks (quantity > 0):
1. Enter symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
2. Enter quantity (e.g., "100") 
3. Enter purchase price (required, e.g., "150.00")
4. Enter purchase date (required)
5. System calculates value, gains/losses normally

### Adding Watchlist Stocks (quantity = 0):
1. Enter symbol (e.g., "TSLA")
2. Enter quantity = 0
3. Purchase price field becomes disabled (shows "N/A for watchlist")
4. Purchase date field becomes disabled (shows "N/A for watchlist")
5. Stock appears in table with:
   - ✅ Current price and all market data (P/E, sector info, etc.)
   - ❌ "N/A" for purchase price, date, total value, gain/loss

### Table Display Logic:
- **Owned Stocks**: Show all data including purchase info and performance metrics
- **Watchlist Stocks**: Show market data only, "N/A" for ownership-related fields
- **Portfolio Summary**: Financial totals exclude watchlist stocks but count shows all items

## Final Column Order:
1. Symbol
2. Current Price  
3. Day Change
4. Quantity *(can now be 0)*
5. Purchase Price *(N/A for watchlist)*
6. Purchase Date *(N/A for watchlist)*

## Benefits:
- ✅ **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant earnings growth column
- ✅ **Watchlist Functionality**: Users can track stocks they're considering without owning them
- ✅ **Smart Validation**: System intelligently handles required fields based on context

All changes are backward compatible - existing owned stocks continue to work exactly as before!
