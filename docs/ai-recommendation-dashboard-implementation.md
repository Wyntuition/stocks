- Tabbed interface (Overview, Diversification, Rebalancing, Signals)
- Loading states and error handling
- Mock data fallback for demonstration
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
```

#### App.tsx Integration
```typescript
// Added to main application:
- AI Analysis button in header with gradient styling
- Modal integration with portfolio data
- State management for dashboard visibility
```

### Backend Services

#### AIRecommendationService.ts
```typescript
// Comprehensive AI analysis service:
- Portfolio analysis with buy/sell signals
- Diversification analysis (sector, market cap, geographic)
- Rebalancing recommendations
- Risk metrics calculation
- Performance analysis
```

#### API Endpoint
```typescript
// New endpoint: GET /api/portfolio/ai-analysis
- Authenticated access
- Portfolio data integration
- Real-time analysis generation
- Error handling and logging
```

### Key Algorithms

#### Buy/Sell Signal Generation
```typescript
// Buy criteria:
- P/E ratio < 25
- Earnings growth > 10%
- ROIC > 10%
- Price above 50-day moving average

// Sell criteria:
- P/E ratio > 40
- Negative earnings growth
- ROIC < 5%
- Price below 50-day moving average
```

#### Diversification Analysis
```typescript
// Sector allocation analysis:
- Technology: 25% recommended
- Healthcare: 15% recommended
- Financial Services: 15% recommended
- Consumer sectors: 15% each recommended
- Other sectors: 5-10% recommended

// Market cap allocation:
- Large Cap: 60% recommended
- Mid Cap: 25% recommended
- Small Cap: 15% recommended

// Geographic allocation:
- US: 70% recommended
- International: 30% recommended
```

#### Rebalancing Logic
```typescript
// Equal-weight rebalancing:
- Calculate current allocation percentages
- Compare to target allocations
- Generate buy/sell recommendations
- Suggest specific quantities for rebalancing
```

## User Experience
