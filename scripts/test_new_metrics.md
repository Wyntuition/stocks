# New Metrics Implementation Test

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested new metrics (Day Change, 6 Month Change, 3 Year Change) in both the backend and frontend:

## Backend Changes

1. **YahooFinanceService.ts**: 
   - Added `get6MonthChange()` and `get3YearChange()` calculation methods
   - Integrated the new metrics into the main `getStockData()` method
   - Updated mock data to include the new properties

2. **Backend Types**: 
   - Added `dayChangePercent`, `change6Month`, `change6MonthPercent`, `change3Year`, `change3YearPercent` to StockData interface

## Frontend Changes

1. **PortfolioTable.tsx**:
   - Added Day Change column after Current Price
   - Added 6 Month Change and 3 Year Change columns after 52-Week Range
   - Updated sorting configuration to support the new columns
   - Applied appropriate color coding (green for positive, red for negative)

2. **Frontend Types**: 
   - Already had the required properties in the StockData interface

## Column Order (as requested)

1. Symbol
2. **Current Price** (moved after symbol)
3. **Day Change** (new)
4. Quantity
5. Purchase Price
6. Purchase Date
7. Total Value

12. 50-Day MA
13. 52-Week Range

16. ROIC
17. Earnings Growth
18. Gross Margin
19. Sales Growth
20. EPS Growth

22. Actions

## Features

- ✅ Day Change: Shows daily percentage change with color coding
- ✅ 6 Month Change: Shows 6-month percentage performance
- ✅ 3 Year Change: Shows 3-year percentage performance
- ✅ Sortable columns for all new metrics
- ✅ Color coding: Green for positive changes, Red for negative changes
- ✅ Backend calculation methods for real Yahoo Finance data
- ✅ Mock data for development/testing

## Removed Columns (as requested)

- ❌ Sector (removed - available in details view)
- ❌ FCF Growth (removed - available in details view)  
- ❌ Dividend Yield (removed - available in details view)

## Next Steps

To test the implementation:
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Visit the portfolio table to see the new columns in action

The new metrics will be calculated from real Yahoo Finance data when available, or display mock data for testing purposes.
